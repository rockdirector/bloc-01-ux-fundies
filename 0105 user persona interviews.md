# User Persona Interviews

## **Amanda D.**
  * Role: Earthy Urban
  * Age: 32
  * Gender: Female
  * Occupation: Non-profit administrator
  * Location: San Francisco
  * Tier: Casual

### _“It's really important that technology fits into my lifestyle.”_

### Bio
Amanda is a married, child-free young professional working a non-tech job for a non-profit in a very tech-driven major city. She considers herself only moderately active despite walking and taking public transit as her primary modes of transportation. Her spouse owns a car but she seldom drives. (He also owns two VR products and Amanda finds them interesting but uncompelling for regular use.) Her non-work interests are "unplugged"--Yoga, patio dining, outdoor walks, beach time, getting away and being outside--and Amanda doesn't feel she needs to be connected at those times.

### Motivations
Amanda mostly uses her smartphone for reading, calls and messaging on her commute and by her at lunch breaks, and it satisfies her current needs for communication, newsreading and step tracking. Her only current wearables are wireless headphones which happily "just work" and she wears them daily with her smartphone. She seems happy to wait until all her needs can be met by turnkey product offerings without too much effort.

### Goals
1. Would appreciate potential health benefits of Wearables
2. Needs them fit into current daily routine with little effort
3. Wants uncomplicated, effective user interaction

### Frustrations
1. Too much daily effort for charging, syncing, etc.
2. Hates current short lifecycle and clear planned obsolescence
3. Does not feel all her needs will be met by current technology

## **Ken C.**
  * Role: Athletic Power Nerd
  * Age: 46
  * Gender: Male
  * Occupation: Systems and network administrator
  * Location: Greater Toronto Area
  * Tier: Professional

### _"[Wearables] need to be functioning tools, not fashion accessories."_

### Bio
Ken is a seasoned network administrator and consultant and owns and operates a hosting service in a college town exurb of the GTA. He commutes 1-2 times a week to his server co-location in Toronto. Physical activity is integral to Ken's lifestyle (he conducted his interview in the middle of a rock climb!) and is fitness and health oriented. He bikes and skateboards as local transportation whenever possible. There are existing smartphone apps for climbing that he would find useful when those could be fully implemented in a lightweight watch.

### Motivations
Ken is an IT professional and uses his smartphone non-stop, primarily for text messaging, and occasional podcast and music streaming. He longs for a smartwatch-style communicator product that would free him from smartphone, but not at the current state of I/O intelligence (he misses the physical qwerty keys of his deprecated Symbian phone.) Ken is very knowledgable about Wearable platforms and benefits, but he is acutely aware of the risks from networks needed to make them work. He feels quite justifiably concerned about continued breaches of cloud data, and believes a regulatory framework is urgently needed to penalize bad actors. Ken will resist adoption until he can confirm his personal data is safe, or until the means exists to perform his own encryption.

### Goals
1. Smartwatch for messaging would be ideal but not until voice recognition is accurate and reliable
2. Demands tech be seamless through environments
3. Wants ability to control/monitor back-end data flow and/or keep as much of his personal data local rather than in the cloud

### Frustrations
1. Does not want unused feature bloat to impact the features he will use
2. Believes health wearables are massively over-promising until the health system is able to process the data into usable, understandable metrics and actionable outcomes
3. Hates being tracked (and subsequently marketed to) with data from devices he feels he has paid substantial up-front costs for

## Name: **Erin M.**
  * Role: Working parent
  * Occupation: Senior Technical Advisor
  * Location: Raleigh, NC
  * Gender: Female
  * Tier: Working Casual

### _"Consumer technology always seems to create as many problems as it solves."_

### Motivations
Erin likes the idea of a Wearable but isn't an early adopter and is waiting for the tech to mature. She finds their appearance generally ugly and styled for nerds. She is very fashion conscious and current design style isn't neutral enough to accessorize to her needs. Her ideal wearable would need to be as discreet and functional as "a star trek comm badge."

### Goals
1. Devices need to be lightweight, comfortable, durable, ideally waterproof
2. Stylish, or at least fashion-neutral
3. Should facilitate clear exercise goals and constant reminders to comply with regimen

### Frustrations
1. She is up to date on the literature that says tracking does not increase people's activity
2. Since she doesn't currently commute her device time is zero-sum
3. Current products seem difficult to use

### Bio
Erin is married with two kids, residing in a blue hipster enclave of a red southern state.
She works remotely from a suburban home, and uses a company-issued Windows 10 laptop exclusively for work. She shares a Mac laptop with her husband who also uses it for his consulting work. She owns an iPhone for work and personal use, and is constantly checking it when not at her laptop. She would love to establish a stronger boundary between home and work time, and she finds that a smartphone has eroded. She loves artistic pursuits and is an avid crafter but this has taken a backseat to her parental and professional obligations. She misses active, car-free city life and is concerned about her sedentary suburban lifestyle over the long-term.
